# Welcome to the docs!

This is a quick start of the docs. As development moves on with nwg 360 I'll be adding more and more to this to help you get started with the react native app and editor.

If you want to edit this page, you can find it in `editor/app/docs/page.mdx` in the `dev` branch of the `nwg-360` repository. These pages are written in Markdown `.md`, `.mdx`, a simple markup language. [Check out this guide to Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

Both Editor and Docs are rendered with Next.js App Router, so the same components can be used in one project. You can find the docs for Next.js [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).
